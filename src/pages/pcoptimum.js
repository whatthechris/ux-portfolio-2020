The benefit of merging the two programs was that millions of existing members would soon be able to collect and spend their points at over 2,500 Loblaws, Shoppers, No Frills and Real Canadian Super Stores nation-wide under one points system, PC Optimum.  The first step was to build a web app which would allow existing members to transfer their legacy points and manage them. Some new features included the ability for members to pool their points with other members of their household,  inquire about any point discrepancies and even donate points to charities."

                  paragraph="Building this complex web application at such a large scale required the collaborative effort of the biggest players in Canada's digital creation space: Loblaws Digital and Konrad Group. Working onsite, I took on a unique role in bridging the gap and blurring the lines between product designer, motion/interaction designer and front-end developer. Moving quickly, I would discuss the new features with the product managers, figure out the UX, design the UI, design the animations if needed and then code it, sometimes all in the same day."

In order to reach as many Canadians as possible, the web app needed to be able to toggle between English and French languages and meet WCAG AA accessibility compliance standards.
